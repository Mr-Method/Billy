Billy is a billing system built with Perl MVC Dancer + Bootstrap + FontAwesome

The goal of this project is to show my proficiency in SQL, Jquery , HTML & CSS and to have fun while doing it. 


**** Please note that this application is not production ready. ****

To run this application on your local machine you can execute the app.pl script under bin directory.

For more instructions on deploying this app you can read the Dancer::Deployment Pod documentation ( https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Deployment ).



Further Notes:

At some point when this project is more mature I will rewrite it to use an ORM and Dancer2 ( https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer2 ).
